Usage:
./astSymbol.py aPyFile.py
./symbolDump.py aPyFile.py

astSymbol.py
	Experiment ast in Python, and collect names from ast,
	then find similar names.
	TODO: add support for finding names in 'visit_import'
	and other statements.

symbolDump.py
	Experiment symtable module in Python, find namespaces
	and symbols in it.
	Attribute names are not parsed by symtable, so can not
	find those information in it.
	This symtable can only lookup names in the current
	namespace, no support for resolving name in inheritance,
	global or nested namespaces.
